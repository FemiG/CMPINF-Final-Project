Femi's dataset came from https://data.wprdc.org/dataset/allegheny-county-air-quality. The description is "Air quality data is collected from the Allegheny County Health Department monitors throughout the county. This data must be verified by qualified individuals before it can be considered official. The following data is unverified. This means that any electrical disruption or equipment malfunction can report erroneous monitored data."

Nickhil's dataset came from https://data.wprdc.org/dataset/pbp-fire-arm-seizures. The description is "This data includes counts of firearms by type seized by the Pittsburgh Bureau of Police. Each row describes a seizure incident involving one or more firearms.

Firearm seizures can occur for several reasons. One of the Bureau of Police justifications for seizing a firearm involves a suspicion that a firearm was used in a criminal offense. Seizures may also occur to protect officer or public safety. For example, a weapon held by someone involved in a serious medical emergency, or an unattended weapon found in a public space may be seized and held for safekeeping.

The Bureauâ€™s firearms tracking unit conducts investigations to determine the rightful owner of firearms that have been seized. Where possible, the Bureau makes every effort to return firearms that have been seized to their rightful owners.

Firearms seized by non-City of Pittsburgh law enforcement agencies within the City of Pittsburgh may not be included in this data. Federal, State, County, and other special law enforcement agencies (e.g. campus, transit, hospital, etc.) operate within the City limits.

Data collected through supplemental reports filled out by Pittsburgh Bureau of Police officers upon taking possession of a firearm.

Locations where the seizure occurred are anonymized to the address block or nearest intersection. It's not always possible to geocode these anonymized addresses. In cases where geocoding fails, the latitude and longitude fields are left empty. These will display as "None" in table views on the WPRDC site.

Exact date and report numbers have been removed to protect the privacy of individuals and any active investigations."

Zhuoran's dataset came from https://data.wprdc.org/dataset/arrest-data. The description is "Arrest data contains information on people taken into custody by City of Pittsburgh police officers. More serious crimes such as felony offenses are more likely to result in an arrest. However, arrests can occur as a result of other offenses, such as parole violations or a failure to appear for trial. All data is reported at the block/intersection level, with the exception of sex crimes, which are reported at the police zone level.

This dataset only contains information reported by City of Pittsburgh Police. It does not contain information about incidents that solely involve other police departments operating within the city (for example, campus police or Port Authority police)."
